          <h2>Information Technology Management</h2>

          <p>As an IT professional, I am passionate about technology and enjoy exploring new software, gadgets, and science fiction movies while keeping up to date with industry trends. I strongly believe in community and volunteerism, providing technology support to non-profits in Nigeria, mentoring IT students, and participating in outreach programs.

Ultimately, my goal is to use technology to solve real-world problems, give back to my community, and promote equitable access to technology..</p>

            <h3>Introducction to Programming in Uokha Gramamr School</h3>
            <p>During my six-month tenure as a programming trainer at Uokha Grammar School in Edo State, Nigeria, I designed and delivered a curriculum that catered to the students' needs and introduced them to basic programming concepts and skills using languages such as Scratch, Python and Java. I worked with school administrators and educators to align the training with academic goals and objectives and provide ongoing support and mentorship to students. Witnessing the students gain confidence in their abilities and develop an interest in programming was a fulfilling experience, as I believe such training is crucial in equipping young people with the necessary skills to make meaningful contributions to society in the digital age.</p>
